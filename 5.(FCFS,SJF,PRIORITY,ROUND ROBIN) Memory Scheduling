# Conclusion :
# The tested scheduling algorithms included:
# 1.	FCFS: Processes executed in arrival order.
# 2.	Priority Scheduling: Higher-priority processes executed first.
# 3.	Round Robin: Processes shared CPU time with a quantum of 2.
# 4.	SJF Preemptive: Prioritized processes with the shortest burst times.
# Overall, SJF Preemptive performed best in managing process execution.
